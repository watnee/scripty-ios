# Scripty for iPhone and iPad

A SwiftUI client for Scripty, the screenplay editor. It talks to the same HAL
API the web app does, and it ships with an offline demo so you can see the
whole editor without an account or a server.

## Start from nothing

On a Mac with none of this yet, one line gets you a running app:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/watnee/scripty-apple/main/scripts/get.sh | bash
```

That checks Xcode, clones this repository into `~/scripty-apple`, and runs the
app. It asks before anything that needs your password, and Xcode itself is the
one thing it cannot install for you — it is a free App Store download, and the
script points you at it and stops.

```sh
... | bash -s -- --dir ~/code/scripty   # clone somewhere else
... | bash -s -- --no-run               # set up, don't launch
... | bash -s -- -- --simulator         # pass the rest to run.sh
```

Rerunning it updates an existing clone and starts the app again. If you would
rather do it by hand, `git clone` this repository and read on.

If a terminal is not your thing, skip the command entirely: download this
repository (the green **Code** button > **Download ZIP**, or `git clone`) and
double-click **Install Scripty.command** inside it. Finder opens it in a
Terminal window and it does exactly what the one-liner does. The first time,
macOS may say it is from an unidentified developer — right-click the file,
choose **Open**, and that button runs it once and remembers.

## Run it

```sh
./scripts/run.sh
```

That is the whole thing. If an unlocked iPhone or iPad is plugged in and this
Mac can sign, Scripty lands on the device; otherwise it opens the offline demo
in a simulator. It says which it chose and why before it starts.

```sh
./scripts/run.sh --simulator             # ignore any plugged-in device
./scripts/run.sh --device                # insist on the real device
./scripts/run.sh --device "Clint iPhone" # pick one by name
./scripts/run.sh -- --reset              # pass the rest to whichever it picks
```

It only chooses between the two commands below, so reach for those directly
when you already know which one you want.

## Try it in the simulator

```sh
./scripts/demo.sh
```

That builds the app, boots an iPad simulator, and opens a sample screenplay in
the offline demo — no account, no backend, nothing to sign. Everything you type
lives in memory and disappears when you uninstall it.

```sh
./scripts/demo.sh --device "iPhone 17"   # pick a simulator by name
./scripts/demo.sh --no-build             # relaunch what is already installed
./scripts/demo.sh --reset                # discard edits from a past demo
```

You need Xcode with an iOS 26.2 simulator runtime (Xcode > Settings >
Components). If `xcodebuild` is missing, point the command-line tools at your
Xcode:

```sh
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app
```

## Put it on your own iPhone or iPad

```sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

Run that, then plug the device in over USB and unlock it. It waits for a device
rather than telling you it found none, finds your signing team, builds,
installs, and launches. The first pairing needs the cable; after that, if you
turn on "Connect via network" for the device in Xcode's Devices window, later
runs find it over Wi-Fi and you can leave the cable out.

```sh
./scripts/install.sh --list                      # show paired devices
./scripts/install.sh --device "Clint iPhone"     # skip the question when several
./scripts/install.sh --team ABCDE12345           # if you have more than one team
./scripts/install.sh --bundle-id com.you.scripty # a name of your choosing
./scripts/install.sh --demo                      # start in the offline demo
./scripts/install.sh --no-launch                 # install without launching
./scripts/install.sh --forget                    # drop the remembered answers
```

Unlike the simulator, a real device insists the app be signed. A free Apple ID
is enough. Four things commonly stand in the way, and the script handles three
of them while you watch rather than leaving you in the build log:

- **Developer Mode is off.** It says so and waits: Settings > Privacy &
  Security > Developer Mode on the device, then restart it.
- **The bundle id is taken.** The default is `scripty.scripty`, which is
  registered to this project's team, so the first build by anyone else fails.
  The script then names the app after your team — `com.<teamid>.scripty` — and
  builds again. Pass `--bundle-id` if you would rather choose.
- **The app installs but won't open.** A free Apple ID signs with a certificate
  the device does not trust until you say so: Settings > General > VPN & Device
  Management > tap your Apple ID > Trust. The script waits for that tap and
  starts the app once you've made it.
- **No certificate.** This one it cannot do for you: open Xcode > Settings >
  Accounts, add your Apple ID, let it create a development certificate, and
  rerun.

Your team, and the bundle id if it had to pick one, are remembered in
`.scripty-install` so later runs need no flags. Waiting and asking need a
terminal — run from a script or CI and it reports the same problems and stops.

Apps signed with a free Apple ID stop working after seven days. Rerun
`install.sh` to renew them.

## Send it to someone else

```sh
./scripts/share.sh
```

That archives a Release build, signs it for distribution, and uploads it to
TestFlight. Testers install Apple's TestFlight app and tap Install — no Mac, no
Xcode, no cable. Processing on Apple's side takes a few minutes; after that you
add people under TestFlight in App Store Connect and they get an email invite.

```sh
./scripts/share.sh --no-upload   # build the .ipa into build/share, don't send it
./scripts/share.sh --ad-hoc      # .ipa for devices already registered to the team
./scripts/share.sh --build 42    # build number, otherwise a UTC timestamp
./scripts/share.sh --out DIR     # where the .ipa lands
```

This is the one path a free Apple ID cannot take: sharing needs a distribution
certificate, which only the paid Developer Program issues. Sending a build also
needs an App Store Connect API key — App Store Connect > Users and Access >
Integrations > App Store Connect API, create one with the App Manager role, and
keep the `.p8` it downloads once:

```sh
./scripts/share.sh --key ~/Downloads/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 --issuer ISSUER-UUID
```

Drop that file in `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/` and the script finds it on
its own; the issuer id can live in `SCRIPTY_ASC_ISSUER`. Two more things
App Store Connect insists on before a first upload: an app record for the bundle
id, and a build number it has not seen — hence the timestamp default.

`--ad-hoc` skips all of that and writes an `.ipa` you can hand over directly,
but it only installs on devices whose UDIDs are already registered at
developer.apple.com > Devices.

## Which server it talks to

By default the app uses the hosted backend in
[AppConfig.swift](scripty/API/AppConfig.swift). To point a build at a server you
are running yourself, set the `scripty.baseURLOverride` user default — for the
simulator:

```sh
xcrun simctl spawn booted defaults write scripty.scripty \
    scripty.baseURLOverride "http://localhost:8080"
```

The offline demo bypasses the network entirely. `demo.sh` always starts there
and `install.sh --demo` does too; on an installed copy the `scripty://demo` URL
does the same, so a Home Screen shortcut can jump straight into it.

## Tests

```sh
./Tests/run.sh
```

The parts of the client that are pure Swift — the stats and pagination
arithmetic, and the demo backend's HAL contract — compile straight from the
app's sources with `swiftc`. There is no XCTest target, so a build's Test action
has nothing to run; this script is what CI exercises, via
[ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh](ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh) on Xcode Cloud.
Anything that needs a running app is out of scope here — use `demo.sh` for that.

| `scripty/HAL`   | Link and collection decoding, the `scripty:*` rel names |
| `scripty/Demo`  | The in-memory backend behind the offline demo           |
| `scripty/Models`| Screenplay blocks, pagination, stats                    |
| `scripty/Views` | The editor and everything around it                     |
