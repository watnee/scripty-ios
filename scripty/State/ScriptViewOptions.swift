//  ScriptViewOptions.swift
//  scripty
//
//  What the script page shows, and whether it can be typed into: the marker
//  badges, the note blocks, and the editing lock. The web app's counterpart is
//  `scriptyInitBlockMarkerToggles` in nav.html, and these use its localStorage
//  keys so the intent stays traceable between the two clients.
//
//  Scoped to one project rather than to the device, again as the web does: a
//  writer marking up a rehearsal draft wants the pins on there and nowhere
//  else. The editing lock goes one narrower still — per edition, falling back
//  to the project — because locking the shooting draft while a revision stays
//  open is the point of having editions at all.
//
//  Nothing here reaches the server. These are choices about looking, not about
//  the script, so there is no link to gate them on and no request to make.
