//
//  SongBlockModel.swift
//  scripty
//
//  The lyric of one song, as ordered lines.
//
//  Follows the screenplay editor's shape because the problems are the same:
//  typing is debounced so every keystroke is not a request, a live-text buffer
//  shields the line being typed into from a reload landing underneath it, and
//  every affordance waits on a link the server advertised.
//
//  Which edition's lyric is being read travels as a link rather than an id the
//  client assembles — the editions collection hands over the `songBlocks` link
//  for each one.
