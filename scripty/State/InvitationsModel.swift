//  Who can see a screenplay: the people who already can, and the people who
//  have been invited to.
//
//  The invitation surface is gated on a link the project advertises, which the
//  server only offers when its `api-invitations` flag is on. So a deployment
//  that has not enabled invitations over the API shows nothing of it at all,
//  rather than a button that fails.
//
//  The access list is not behind that flag, and is deliberately loaded even
//  when invitations are off — a role or a team grants access with no invitation
//  involved, so "nobody has been invited" was never the same answer as "nobody
//  else can see this".
