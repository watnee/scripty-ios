//  BlockSelectionModel.swift
//  scripty
//
//  Which elements the writer has selected for a bulk action.
//
//  The web app has two unrelated selection systems — a set of row checkboxes
//  that drives every bulk endpoint, and a separate Notion-style drag selection
//  that is purely visual. Only the first one means anything to the server, so
//  only the first one is modelled here; on a touch device a tap-to-select mode
//  is the natural equivalent of the checkbox column.
