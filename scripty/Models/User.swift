//
//  User.swift
//  scripty
//
//  An account on the server. Managing users is an admin task, which is why the
//  API root only advertises the `users` rel to an admin — the same gate the web
//  app puts behind ROLE_ADMIN. A deployment or account without that rel sees no
//  user-management UI at all, rather than a screen that 403s.
//
//  The resource carries the account's identity and its role flags; what an admin
//  may do with one travels as links (`update`, `delete`), not as computed rules.
