//  Deleting has always been a soft delete on the server; the client just had no
//  way to read the trash, so every delete looked final from the iPad and was
//  reversible from the browser. `purgeAt` matters as much as the item itself —
//  recovery has a deadline, and a list that cannot say when is asking the
//  writer to guess.
