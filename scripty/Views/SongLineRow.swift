//
//  SongLineRow.swift
//  scripty
//
//  One line of a lyric, as a row in a list.
//
//  Split out from the song editor because the workspace — every song in the
//  project on one screen — has to render the same line, with the same actions
//  and the same saving behaviour, inside a list it does not own. Two
//  implementations of "a lyric line" would drift apart on the first change to
//  either.
//
//  The line itself is a UITextView bridged into SwiftUI rather than a plain
//  `TextField`, for one reason SwiftUI's field cannot give: a `TextField` has
//  no spell-check control, so a writer who turns spellcheck off in the view
//  options still saw red squiggles under every lyric — the one surface that
//  ignored the preference the screenplay and notes editors already honour. A
//  UITextView can be told, exactly as `BlockTextView` tells its own.
